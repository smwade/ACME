Love is patient Love is kind
It does not envy It does not boast
It is not proud It is not rude
It is not self-seeking It is not easily angered
It keeps no record of wrongs
Love does not delight in evil
but rejoices with the truth
It always protects always trusts
always hopes always perseveres
Love never fails
