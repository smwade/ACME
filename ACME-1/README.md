### Lab1 - Getting Started

Explore the powerful and simple syntax of python.

### Lab2 - NumPy and SciPy

Create and manipulate Numpy arrays and learn features available in Numpy and Scipy.

### Lab3 - Plotting

Exploring plotting in matplotlib and mayavi.

### Lab4 - Complexity and Sparse Matrices

Introduce temporal and spacial complexity and explore SciPy's sparse methods. 

### Lab5 - Affine Transformations of Linear Systems

Apply affine transformations to a set of vectors in R2 and solve linear systems.

### Lab6 - QR Decomposition

Use the Gram-Schmidt algorithm and orthonormal transformations to perform the QR decomposition.

### Lab7 - Least Squares and Eigenvalue Solvers

Use least squares to fit curves to data and use QR decomposition to find eigenvalues.

### Lab8 - Image Segmentation

Understand some basic applications of eigenvalues to graph theory. Learn how to calculate Laplacian matrix of a graph. Apply the Laplacian matrix to determine connectivity of a graph and to segment an image.

### Lab9 - SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)

Learn how to compute the compact SVD and explore the SVD as a method of image compression.

### Lab10 - Facial Recognition

Use the singular value decomposition to build a facial recognition system.

### Lab11 - Data Vizualization

Use data visualizations to explore data and communicate e↵ectively to others.

### Lab12 - Numerical Approximation of Derivatives

Understand and implement finite difference approximations of the derivative in single and multiple dimensions. Evaluate the accuracy of these approximations. Then use finite difference quotients to find edges in images via the Sobel filter.

### Lab13 - Conditioning and Stability

Explore the condition of problems and the stability of algorithms

### Lab14 - Newton's Method

Understand Newton’s Method. Understand the definition of a basin of attraction.

### Lab15 - Monte Carlo Integration

Implement Monte Carlo integration to estimate integrals. Use Monte Carlo Integration to calculate the integral of the joint normal distribution.

### Lab16 - More Monte Carlo

Use importance sampling to reduce the error and variance of Monte Carlo Simulations.

### Lab17 - Sparse Grid

Sparse Grids are an important tool when dealing with highdimensional problems. Computers operate in discrete space, not in continuous space. It is important to choose evaluation points wisely so as to maximize accuracy without sacrificing computation time. In particular, we explore how to use sparse grids to compute integrals of high dimensionality.

### Lab18 - Profiling Python Code

Identify which portions of the code are most time consuming using a profiler. Optimize Python code using good coding practices and just-in-time compilation with Numba.

### Lab19 - Complex Numbers

Visualize complex functions to estimate their zeros and poles.

### Lab20 - Complex Integration

Understand some simple uses of residues and singularities in the complex plane.

### Lab21 - PageRank

Implement the PageRank Algorithm and understand the theory behind it.

### Lab22 - Arnoldi Iteration

Use Krylov subspaces to find eigenvalues of extremely large matrices.

### Lab23 - GMRES

In this lab we will learn how to use the GMRES algorithm.

### Lab24 - Pseudospectra

The Pseudospectrum of a matrix is related to its eigenvalues. The Pesudospectra of normal and non-normal matrices will be investigated. We will plot pseudospectra and examine the characteristics of different types of matrices.
